# Question 1
What is the difference between traditional programming and Machine Learning?

* ~~In traditional programming, a programmer has to formulate or code rules manually, whereas, in Machine Learning, the algorithm automatically formulates the rules from the data.~~
* Machine learning identifies complex activities such as golf, while traditional programming is better suited to simpler activities such as walking.

>Correct
Exactly! Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.

# Question 2
What do we call the process of telling the computer what the data represents (i.e. this data is for walking, this data is for running)?

* Learning the Data
* ~~Labelling the Data~~
* Categorizing the Data
* Programming the Data

>Correct
Yes! Labeling typically takes a set of unlabeled data and augments each piece of it with informative tags.

# Question 3
What is a Dense layer?

* A layer of disconnected neurons
* A single neuron
* ~~A layer of connected neurons~~
* An amount of mass occupying a volume

>Correct
Correct! In Keras, dense is used to define a layer of connected neurons.

* Question 4
How do you measure how good the current ‘guess’ is?

* ~~Using the Loss function~~
* Training a neural network
* Figuring out if you win or lose

>Correct
Absolutely!  An optimization problem seeks to minimize a loss function.

# Question 5
What does the optimizer do?

* Decides to stop training a neural network
* Measures how good the current guess is
* ~~Generates a new and improved guess~~
* Figures out how to efficiently compile your code

>Correct
Nailed it! The optimizer figures out the next guess based on the loss function.

# Question 6
What is Convergence?

* A programming API for AI
* An analysis that corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular set of data.
* ~~The process of getting very close to the correct answer~~
* A dramatic increase in loss

>Correct
That’s right! Convergence is when guesses get better and better closing to a 100% accuracy.

# Question 7
What does model.fit do?

* It optimizes an existing model
* It makes a model fit available memory
* ~~It trains the neural network to fit one set of values to another~~
* It determines if your activity is good for your body

>Correct
Correct! The training takes place on the fit command.
